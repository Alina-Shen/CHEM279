# Description
This is the reference code for HW3. It reads the molecular input of a closed-shell system composed exclusively of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms, along with the corresponding basis set, and calculates the Extended Huckel Theory (EHT) energy.

To compile the code on Datahub, enter the command `make all` under this directory.

# Usage
```
./hw3 <filename>
```
`<filename>`: The path to the input file containing information of the molecule.
